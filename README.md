# staff-management
Test task: Implement CRUD for workers, assign and unassign staff to departments as SOAP-webservice.&#12288;

Enjoyed doing this.&#12288;

This is Spring Boot app. It also uses Spring Data CrudRepository, slf4j logging, caching, jaxb class compilation. &#12288;

I used H2 inmemory DB to make it simple.&#12288;

Script of filling DB is in /src/resources/data.sql

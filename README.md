# staff-management
Test task: Implement CRUD for workers, assign and unassign staff to departments as SOAP-webservice

Enjoyed doing this.

This is Spring Boot app. It also uses Spring Data CrudRepository, slf4j logging, caching, jaxb class compilation.
I used H2 inmemory DB to make it simple.
Script of filling DB is in /src/resources/data.sql
